                            üê∂ Image Classification for a City Dog Show üê∂
This was the first project for the Artificial Intelligence Programming with Python Nanodegree from Udacity. In this project my task was to use 
a pre-trained image classifier(eg. VGG, Resnet) to identify dog breeds. 

‚úî Description

My city is hosting a citywide dog show and I have volunteered to help the organising committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must 
submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog i.e. the breed name. The registration system tags the images based upon the 
biographical information. 
Some people are planning on registering pets that aren‚Äôt actual dogs. I need to to make sure the participants are dogs.

‚úî Objectives

1. To correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs
2. To orrectly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs
3. To Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives above
   The output in terms of time and correctly classified breeds is contained in the *.txt files i.e vgg_pet_images.txt, alexnet_pet_images.txt
